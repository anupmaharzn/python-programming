# variable are contianers for storing data values

# python has no command for declaring a variables (like javascript has var let const)

# variable names are case-sensitive

# rules for variable names
    # Names cannot start with number
    # there can be no spaces in the nam, user _ instead
    # cant use any of speical symbols


# python uses dynamic typing  (like javascript)

my_income = 100 # int data type

tax_rate = 0.13 # float data type

my_taxes = my_income * tax_rate

print('tax that i have to pay is',my_taxes)
