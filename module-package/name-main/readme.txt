#An often confusing part of python is a mysterious line of code:

if __name__ == "__main__":

#sometimes when you are importing from a module, you would like to know wheather a modules function is being used as an import, or if you are using the original .py file of that module direclty.

#when you run your .py script file all of the code at indentation lvl 0 going to get run
#function and class at indentation lvl 0 is going to be defined

# in python we have built in variable __name__

# if i run python one.py directly ,it assign __name__ variable equal to "__main__"
