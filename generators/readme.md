# we learned how to create functions with def and the return statement

# generator functions allow us to write a function that can send back a value and then later resume to pick up where it left off.

# generator is a special type of iterator that allows you to iterate over a potentially large sequence of data without loading the entire sequence into memory at once.

# generators are deined using a dunction with the `yeild` keyword.

# for example, the range() function doesnt produce an list in memeory for all the values from start to stop.instead it just keeps track of the last number and the step size , to provide a flow of numbers.
